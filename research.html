            <p>My research focuses in the the statistical and computational challenges arising in the analysis of
                large scale structure data in cosmology. Cosmology is currently experiencing an unprecedented rise
                in the quantity and quality of data. The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) has already
                recorded more galaxy spectra in its first two years of operations than previously done in the whole
                history of humanity. Moreover, next-generation surveys such as Legacy Survey of Space and Time
                (LSST), Euclid, the Nancy Grace Roman space telescope, the Simons Observatory
                promise to further accelerate this trend in the next decade. In order to match the quality of the data,
                physicists are starting to incorporate into their theoretical predictions more of the physical, observational
                and instrumental effects which, until now, could be overlooked. In practice this translates into a
                dramatic increase in the number of parameters that future analyses will have to consider. </p>

            <p>This combination
                of large data sets with complex models will overwhelm current inference methods, greatly
                limiting the scope of future cosmological analyses to the point of defeating the purpose of the newly
                commissioned facilities. My work tackles the challenges posed by the up-coming generation of data in two distinctive ways.
                I am interested in increasing the scope of cosmological models as well as improving models of systematic
                effects to resolve the current inconsistencies between different cosmological analyses. I also
                aim to accelerate the inference methods by which models are constrained given the greatest and
                latest data sets. In order to do so I make extensive use of machine learning methods and new
                computational methods.</p>
